    <h2>java</h2>
    <p><pre>explore the top java courses.
        Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. 
        It is a widely used robust technology. 
        Java is a programming language and a platform.

    <h2>python</h2>
    <p><pre>explore the top python courses.Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
        Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
         Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
         logical code for small and large-scale projects.</pre></p>
    <h2>javascript</h2>
    <p><pre>explore the top javascript courses.
        JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. 
        It is also known as scripting language for web pages. 
        It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. 
        JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.</pre></p>
    <h2>c++</h2>
    <p><pre>explore the top c++ courses.
        C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
        It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[10]

        C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
        [11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, 
        
        with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[12]</pre></p>
